This is a series of Challenges created by Dannyma. I am trying to solve the cases. here is the link to the tasks: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/

First I am trying to clean the data. 
Trying to remove the null values from customer_orders 

with t_cust_orders as
( 
      SELECT order_id, customer_id, pizza_id,
             (case when exclusions is null or exclusions like '%null%' then ''
                  else exclusions 
             end) as exclusion,
             (case when extras is null or extras like '%null%' then '' 
                  else extras 
             end) as extras, 
             order_time 
      from pizza_runner.customer_orders
 ) 
 select * from t_cust_orders
 
 with t_runner_orders as 
( 
  select order_id, runner_id,
  		(case when pickup_time is null or pickup_time like '%null%' then '' 
         	  else pickup_time 
         end) as pickup_time,
  		 (case when distance is null or distance like '%null%' then ''
  			  when distance like '%km' then trim ('km' from distance)
  			  else distance
  	     end) as distance, 
         (case when duration is null or duration like '%null%' then '' 
         	  when duration like '%mins' then trim ('mins' from duration) 
              when duration like '%minute' then trim ('minute' from duration)
              when duration like '%minutes' then trim ('minutes' from duration)
              else duration 
         end) as duration,
         (case when cancellation is null or cancellation like '%null%' then '' 
         	  else cancellation 
         end) as cancellation
   from pizza_runner.runner_orders 
) 
select * from t_runner_orders

      (select order_id, order_time, 
             (case when extract(dow from order_time) = 0 then 'Sunday'
                  when extract(dow from order_time) = 1 then 'Monday'
                  when extract(dow from order_time) = 2 then 'Tuesday'
                  when extract(dow from order_time) = 3 then 'Wednesday'
                  when extract(dow from order_time) = 4 then 'Thursday'
                  when extract(dow from order_time) = 5 then 'Friday'
                  when extract(dow from order_time) = 6 then 'Saturday'
             end) Day_of_Week
      from t_cust_orders 
      )t
group by Day_of_week

B. Runner and Customer Experience
1.How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
select extract(week from registration_date) as week, count(runner_id) as no_of_runner_registered
from pizza_runner.runners
group by extract(week from registration_date)

2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
select runner_id, extract(minutes from avg(time_taken)) as time_taken
from 
      (select runner_id, to_timestamp(pickup_time, 'yyyy-mm-dd HH24:MI:SS'), order_time, (to_timestamp(pickup_time, 'yyyy-mm-dd HH24:MI:SS') - order_time) as time_taken
      from t_runner_orders r
      join t_cust_orders c 
      on r.order_id = c.order_id
      where cancellation = '') t1
group by runner_id
order by runner_id

3.Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
select pizza_count, extract(minutes from avg(prep_time)) as prep_time
from                                
      (select c.order_id, count(pizza_id) as Pizza_count, avg(to_timestamp(pickup_time, 'yyyy-mm-dd HH24:MI:SS') - order_time) as prep_time
      from t_runner_orders r
      join t_cust_orders c 
      on r.order_id = c.order_id
      where cancellation =''
      group by c.order_id)t1
group by pizza_count
order by pizza_count

4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
select customer_id, round(avg(cast(distance as numeric)),2) as avg_distance
from t_runner_orders r
join t_cust_orders c 
on r.order_id = c.order_id
where cancellation =''
group by customer_id 
order by avg_distance                              

5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
select (Max(cast(duration as int)) - Min(cast(duration as int))) as diff 
from t_runner_orders r
join t_cust_orders c 
on r.order_id = c.order_id
where cancellation =''

6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
select runner_id, round(avg((cast(distance as numeric)/cast(duration as int))),2) as avg_speed
from t_runner_orders  
where cancellation = ''
group by runner_id
order by avg_speed 

/* Fastest is runner 2 */

7.What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
select runner_id, succ, tot, ((succ*100)/tot) as succ_per
from 
    (select runner_id, 
           sum(case when duration <> '' then 1 
               else 0 end) as succ, count(order_id) as tot 
    from t_runner_orders 
    group by runner_id) t

C. Ingredient Optimisation

For solving this section i am adding one more temp table by spliting extras and exclusions as ex1, ex2, exc1, exc2
t_cust_orders2 as
    (
    select order_id, customer_id, pizza_id, 
          split_part(extras,',',1) as ex1, split_part(extras,',',2) as ex2,
          split_part(exclusions,',',1) as exc1, split_part(exclusions,',',2) as exc2,
      	  order_time
    from t_cust_orders
    )  
    
2.What was the most commonly added extra?
select ex1, ex2, count(ex1), count(ex2) from t_cust_orders2
group by ex1, ex2
