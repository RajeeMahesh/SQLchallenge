This is a series of Challenges created by Dannyma. I am trying to solve the cases. here is the link : https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/

First I am trying to clean the data. 
Trying to remove the null values from customer_orders 

with t_cust_orders as
( 
      SELECT order_id, customer_id, pizza_id,
             (case when exclusions is null or exclusions like '%null%' then ''
                  else exclusions 
             end) as exclusion,
             (case when extras is null or extras like '%null%' then '' 
                  else extras 
             end) as extras, 
             order_time 
      from pizza_runner.customer_orders
 ) 
 select * from t_cust_orders
 
 with t_runner_orders as 
( 
  select order_id, runner_id,
  		(case when pickup_time is null or pickup_time like '%null%' then '' 
         	  else pickup_time 
         end) as pickup_time,
  		 (case when distance is null or distance like '%null%' then ''
  			  when distance like '%km' then trim ('km' from distance)
  			  else distance
  	     end) as distance, 
         (case when duration is null or duration like '%null%' then '' 
         	  when duration like '%mins' then trim ('mins' from duration) 
              when duration like '%minute' then trim ('minute' from duration)
              when duration like '%minutes' then trim ('minutes' from duration)
              else duration 
         end) as duration,
         (case when cancellation is null or cancellation like '%null%' then '' 
         	  else cancellation 
         end) as cancellation
   from pizza_runner.runner_orders 
) 
select * from t_runner_orders

A. Pizza Metrics

1.How many pizzas were ordered?
  select count(order_id) from t_cust_orders
  
2.How many unique customer orders were made?
select count(distinct order_id) from t_cust_orders

3.How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
select runner_id, count(order_id) from t_runner_orders
where cancellation = ' '
group by runner_id

4.How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
select c.pizza_id, pizza_name, count(c.order_id) as no_of_p_delivered
from t_cust_orders c 
join t_runner_orders r 
on c.order_id = r.order_id
join pizza_runner.pizza_names p 
on c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
where cancellation = ' '
group by c.pizza_id, pizza_name

5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
select customer_id, c.pizza_id, pizza_name, count(c.pizza_id) 
from t_cust_orders c 
join pizza_runner.pizza_names p 
on c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
group by customer_id, c.pizza_id, pizza_name
order by customer_id

6.What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
select max(count) as max_no_of_pizza_ordered
from 
      (select order_id, count(pizza_id) as count
      from t_cust_orders
      group by order_id
      order by order_id) t1
      
7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
 select customer_id, 
 		  count(case when extras = '' and exclusions = '' then 1
              end) as no_change,
          count(case when extras <> '' or exclusions <> '' then 1
              end) as more_change
 from t_runner_orders r 
 join t_cust_orders c 
 on r.order_id = c.order_id
 where cancellation = ''
 group by customer_id
 order by customer_id
 
 8.How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
 select sum(both_changed) as both_changed
from 
      (select customer_id, 
                count(case when extras <> '' and exclusions <> '' then 1
                    end) as both_changed
       from t_runner_orders r 
       join t_cust_orders c 
       on r.order_id = c.order_id
       where cancellation = ''
       group by customer_id
       order by customer_id)t1
 
 9.What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
 select extract(hour from order_time) as hour, count(order_id)
from t_cust_orders
group by extract(hour from order_time)
order by extract(hour from order_time)

10.What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
