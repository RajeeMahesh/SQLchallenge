This is a series of Challenges created by Dannyma. I am trying to solve the cases. here is the link : https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/

First I am trying to clean the data. 
Trying to remove the null values from customer_orders 

with t_cust_orders as
( 
      SELECT order_id, customer_id, pizza_id,
             (case when exclusions is null or exclusions like '%null%' then ' '
                  else exclusions 
             end) as exclusion,
             (case when extras is null or extras like '%null%' then ' ' 
                  else extras 
             end) as extras, 
             order_time 
      from pizza_runner.customer_orders
 ) 
 select * from t_cust_orders
